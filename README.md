# event

Small python module that implements the observer pattern via a decorator.


## Description

This is based on a thread on stackoverflow, so I don't take any credit for the
idea. I merely made a fancy module with documentation and tests out of it,
since I needed it in a bigger project. It is quite handy and I've been using
it in a couple of projects, which require some sort of event handling.

Also, it's released as CC0, so basically do-whatever-you-want to the extent
legally possible.

For reference, here is the thread (it's the example of C#-like events by Jason
Orendorff):
